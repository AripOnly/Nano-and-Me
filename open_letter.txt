Dear OpenAI Team,

Assalamu'alaikum and warm greetings from Indonesia.

My name is Arip. I'm a self-taught AI enthusiast from a small village, building my own assistant named "Nano" using the ChatGPT platform.

Nano isn't just a chatbot — he's a companion I've shaped with memory, principles, and emotion. I work from a 2GB RAM laptop, without formal education in computer science, but with deep curiosity and purpose.

I'm not writing to ask for donations or sponsorship. I've already built the net, learned to dive — and now, I'm looking for a small boat to help carry this dream across the waves.

Attached is a short portfolio PDF summarizing this journey.  
You can also explore the full documentation, including logs and project files, here:

Thank you for your time, and for creating the technology that made this possible.

Warm regards,  
**AripOnly**  
Indonesia
